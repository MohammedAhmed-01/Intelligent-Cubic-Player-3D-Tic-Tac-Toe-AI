# 🎲 Intelligent Cubic Player – 3D Tic-Tac-Toe AI

An advanced AI-powered player for the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game, extended into a three-dimensional 4x4x4 cube. This project leverages sophisticated algorithms to provide a challenging, strategic, and adaptive opponent.

📌 Project Overview

This Intelligent Cubic Player is designed to play Tic-Tac-Toe in 3D, analyzing the game state across multiple layers and making optimal moves using state-of-the-art AI techniques such as:

Minimax Algorithm for exhaustive game tree exploration

Alpha-Beta Pruning to optimize search efficiency

Heuristic Evaluation Functions for strategic move scoring

The AI adapts dynamically to different play styles, ensuring a competitive and fair match for human players.
